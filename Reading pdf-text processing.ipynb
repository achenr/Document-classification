      "program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in \n",
      "appropriate scientific disciplines to address the Nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical \n",

      "\n",
      "The NRSA program has been the primary means of supporting predoctoral and postdoctoral \n",
      "research training programs since enactment of the NRSA legislation in 1974.  Research training \n",

      "health services research, or in any other discipline relevant to the NIH mission. \n",
      "\n",
      "Institutional NRSA programs allow the Training Program Director/Principal Investigator (Training \n",
      "PD/PI) to select the trainees and develop a program of coursework, research experiences, and \n",
      "technical and/or professional skills development appropriate for the selected trainees. Each \n",
      "program should provide high-quality research training and offer opportunities in addition to \n",

      "training related expenses, including health insurance, for the appointed trainees in accordance \n",
      "with the approved NIH support levels. \n",
      "\n",
      "Program Objective \n",
      "Recent advances in medical informatics, electronic health records, big data analytics, mobile \n",
      "and wearable technologies, social media and web generated data, geospatial data, \n",
      "administrative data, and new methods to link data have laid the groundwork for a rich \n",
      "biomedical, behavioral, and social research data environment. The voluminous data \n",
      "environment resulting from diverse data sources will require complex analytical skills to derive \n",

      "Applying advanced analytic approaches to these kinds of data provides opportunities to \n",
      "transform the spatiotemporal analysis of demographics, behaviors, social interactions, and \n",

      "data are becoming increasingly interdisciplinary as they are combined and merged with \n",
      "biomedical, genetic, geospatial, and administrative data. Successful collection and rigorous \n",
      "analysis of complex behavioral and social science health data will require: solid scientific critical \n",

      "earlier career training exposure to data science and computational approaches applied in other \n",
      "disciplines such as computer science, applied statistics, and engineering. Training programs \n",
